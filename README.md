# Product-lists-for-inventory-and-invoicing
Program that manages a list of products for inventory and invoicing using dynamic lists with generic programming and the LinkedList Java class

Manage the list of products to be recorded in inventory. The retail price is calculated based on cost.

cost is less than and equal to $100, the profit will be 20%.
cost is higher than $100, the profit will be 15%.
Collect product data, from a code, description, cost, etc.

Subsequently, you can generate the invoice of the products according to the purchase of the products made by the customers.

Implement the following in Java:

A program using dynamic lists.
In the program there must be an interface with the user that allows:
1. Product management

2. Invoice management

3. Customer management

4. Exit

In case the option is 1:

1.1 Enter product

2.4 Cancel invoice

In case the option is 3:

3.1 Enter customer
3.2 Consult customer 
3.3 Show all customers
3.4 Delete customer 

When section 2.1 is chosen, the price and stock must be consulted internally before invoicing.

Note: The product list must contain several products:
The product list must record several products.
The invoice list must record several invoices.
The customer list must handle several customers.
An invoice can record several products with their respective quantities.
The invoice at the time of issuing must be active and when the invoice is cancelled its status must be inactive (logically deleted).
The implementation must be done with
